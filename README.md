# :snake: Python Exercises 

Here are some Python exercises I worked on to learn this language. For now, the exercises are mostly based on the LinkedIn Learning course created by Ryan Mitchell.

## Description Of Each Exercise
### 1. List comprehensions
With an specified input (containing sentences), the program will give you as an output, the count for each duplicated word. If a word is not duplicated, it will not appear in the output.

### 2. Prime challenge
This program gives you all the prime numbers until a limit. The idea was to play with continue/break in loops, to get an optimized performance.

### 3. Server status
An imitation of a server up and down. If the server is down, we return None. If the server is up, we return the message. The difficulty is that each message has only a certain percent of chance to be successful. So it was needed to give some tries before considering the server down.

### 4. Messenger extension
The exercise is about extending an existing class, to implement custom methods. I also added some minor features like clearing the messages after printed them out, or declaring the messages array as a private attribute, so it's inaccessible outside of the class definition.

### 5. Band Name Generator
From Udemy Python Bootcamp 2023. Generates a band name based on hometown and pet's name, input by the user.

### 6. Tip Calculator
From Udemy Python Bootcamp 2023. Calculates a tip by asking the total bill, percentage tip and number of people to split with.
