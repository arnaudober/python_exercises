# :snake: Python Exercises 

Here are some Python exercises I worked on to learn this language.

Above, all exercises come from Udemy Python Bootcamp 2023. I didn't described all exercises in this file as there are a lot of them. I only described the final exercise of each chapter of the lesson.

### 1. Band Name Generator
Generates a band name based on hometown and pet's name, input by the user.

### 2. Tip Calculator
Calculates a tip by asking the total bill, percentage tip and number of people to split with.

### 3. Treasure Island End
Do you remember these adventure books where you could choose the progression of the story? This program is one like that. The goal was to use conditions (remember: Switch don't exist in Python!)

### 4. Rock Paper Scissors
I don't think I need to introduce this famous game. Using ASCII art, it's a user vs computer game. Using functions, lists, ASCII art, random module and conditions.

### 5. Password generator
A simple password generator. You choose the count of letters/symbols/numbers for your password. The password is created with random characters/positions corresponding to your requirements (e.g. 2 letters & 2 symbols will give you a 4 length password, with random letters and symbols, at random positions).

### 6. Hangman
Once again a classic game. What I tried to work on with this challenge is the flow chart. And splitting the development in multiple steps, incremental, from simple to more difficult.

### 7. Caesar Cipher
Encryption/decryption methods using Python. Goal was to play with methods, refactor them, reuse them, etc, to fully understand them.
