# :snake: Python Exercises 

Here are some Python exercises I worked on to learn this language. For now, the exercises are mostly based on the LinkedIn Learning course created by Ryan Mitchell.

## Description Of Each Exercise
### 1. List comprehensions
With an specified input (containing sentences), the program will give you as an output, the count for each duplicated word. If a word is not duplicated, it will not appear in the output.

### 2. Prime challenge
This program gives you all the prime numbers until a limit. The idea was to play with continue/break in loops, to get an optimized performance.

### 3. Server status
An imitation of a server up and down. If the server is down, we return None. If the server is up, we return the message. The difficulty is that each message has only a certain percent of chance to be successful. So it was needed to give some tries before considering the server down.

### 4. Messenger extension
The exercise is about extending an existing class, to implement custom methods. I also added some minor features like clearing the messages after printed them out, or declaring the messages array as a private attribute, so it's inaccessible outside of the class definition.

### 5. Band Name Generator
Generates a band name based on hometown and pet's name, input by the user.

### 6. Tip Calculator
Calculates a tip by asking the total bill, percentage tip and number of people to split with.

### 7. Treasure Island End
Do you remember these adventure books where you could choose the progression of the story? This program is one like that. The goal was to use conditions (remember: Switch don't exist in Python!)

### 8. Rock Paper Scissors
I don't think I need to introduce this famous game. Using ASCII art, it's a user vs computer game. Using functions, lists, ASCII art, random module and conditions.

### 9. Password generator
A simple password generator. You choose the count of letters/symbols/numbers for your password. The password is created with random characters/positions corresponding to your requirements (e.g. 2 letters & 2 symbols will give you a 4 length password, with random letters and symbols, at random positions).

### 10. Hangman
Once again a classic game. What I tried to work on with this challenge is the flow chart. And splitting the development in multiple steps, incremental, from simple to more difficult.

### 11. Caesar Cipher
Encryption/decryption methods using Python. Goal was to play with methods, refactor them, reuse them, etc, to fully understand them.
