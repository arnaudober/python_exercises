# :snake: Python Exercises 

Here are some Python exercises I worked on to learn this language. For now, the exercises are mostly based on the LinkedIn Learning course created by Ryan Mitchell.

## Description Of Each Exercise
### 1. List comprehensions
With an specified input (containing sentences), the program will give you as an output, the count for each duplicated word. If a word is not duplicated, it will not appear in the output.

### 2. Prime challenge
This program gives you all the prime numbers until a limit. The idea was to play with continue/break in loops, to get an optimized performance.
