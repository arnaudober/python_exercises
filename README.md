Above, all exercises come from Udemy Python Bootcamp 2023. I didn't described all exercises in this file as there are a
lot of them. I only described the final exercise of each chapter of the lesson.

> [!TIP]
> Most playful and complex exercises to develop are marked with a :star: emoji.

### 1. Band Name Generator

Generates a band name based on hometown and pet's name, input by the user.

### 2. Tip Calculator

Calculates a tip by asking the total bill, percentage tip and number of people to split with.

### 3. Treasure Island End

Do you remember these adventure books where you could choose the progression of the story? This program is one like
that. The goal was to use conditions (remember: Switch don't exist in Python!)

### 4. Rock Paper Scissors

I don't think I need to introduce this famous game. Using ASCII art, it's a user vs computer game. Using functions,
lists, ASCII art, random module and conditions.

### 5. Password generator

A simple password generator. You choose the count of letters/symbols/numbers for your password. The password is created
with random characters/positions corresponding to your requirements (e.g. 2 letters & 2 symbols will give you a 4 length
password, with random letters and symbols, at random positions).

### 6. Hangman

Once again a classic game. What I tried to work on with this challenge is the flow chart. And splitting the development
in multiple steps, incremental, from simple to more difficult.

### 7. Caesar Cipher

Encryption/decryption methods using Python. Goal was to play with methods, refactor them, reuse them, etc, to fully
understand them.

### 8. Silent Auction

Playing with dictionaries and lists, the goal was to create a silent auction, and return the winner at the end of the
program, who has the highest bid.

### 9. Calculator

This time, we played with functions and storing functions in a dictionary. The main function is recursive as well.

### 10. Blackjack :star:

A wrap up project to use all the things we learnt so far. By creating the chart flow, to the full development of the
program.

### 11. Guess the number

A simple game where the computer chooses a random number, and the user has to guess it. The computer will give hints to
the user to help him find the number. The user has 10 attempts to find the number.

### 12. Higher Lower Followers

A game where you have to guess which Instagram account has the most followers.

### 13. Coffee Machine :star:

A simple coffee machine program. The user can choose between 3 types of coffee, and the machine will ask for the
money. (procedural and OOP versions)

### 14. Quiz Game :star:

A simple quiz game. The user has to answer 10 questions, and the program will return the score at the end. I load the
questions dynamically from OpenTrivia DB API, using urllib and json modules.
